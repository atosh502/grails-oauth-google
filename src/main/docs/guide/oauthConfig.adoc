With our dependencies added, we need to configure security.

Create a file `application.groovy` with the following content `staticRules` configuration.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.groovy[indent=0,tag=staticRules]
----

Add the next block to configure Grails Spring Security Rest Plugin:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.groovy[indent=0,tag=grailsPluginSpringSecurityRest]
----
<1> You must disable bearer token support to register your own tokenReader implementation.
<2> Enable anonymous access to URL's where the Grails Spring Security Rest plugin's filters are applied
<3> Required secret which is used to sign the JWT tokens.
<4> Callback url, after selecting your google user this is callback url will be invoked with a JWT token which authenticates the user
<5> Which pac4j client to use; in our case the Google client
<6> Open your `client_id.json` you downloaded while setting up Google. You will supply `client_id` as the System Property `GOOGLE_KEY` when you start the app.
<7> Open your `client_id.json` you downloaded while setting up Google. You will supply `client_secret` as the System Property `GOOGLE_SECRET` when you start the app.
<8> The scope can be from any value of the enum org.pac4j.oauth.client.Google2Client.Google2Scope
<9> Specific roles that Google authentication is allowed to access
<10> We are going to authenticate our users only against Google. Thus, we use only the anonymous authentication provider. Read more about https://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/latest/#authenticationProviders[Authentication Providers] in Spring Security Core Plugin documentation.

To start the app you will need to supply `client_id` and `client_secret` as system properties. e.g.:

`./gradlew -DGOOGLE_KEY=XXXXXX -DGOOGLE_SECRET=XXXX bootRun


WARNING: While the scope can be from any value of the enum org.pac4j.oauth.client.Google2Client.Google2Scope, if you use
the default OauthUserDetailsService, you need to use EMAIL_AND_PROFILE. That is because the default implementation uses
the profile ID as the username, and that is only returned by Google if EMAIL_AND_PROFILE scope is used.

We want our app stateless by default with some endpoints which allow anonymous access.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.groovy[indent=0,tag=filterChain]
----

<1> stateless chain that allows anonymous access when no token is sent. If however a token is on the request, it will be validated.

<2> /** is a stateless chain that doesn't allow anonymous access. Thus, the token will always be required, and if missing, a Bad Request reponse will be sent back to the client.


NOTE: We are not persisting User information in the database. You may have noticed we don't have `User`, `Role`, `UserRole` domain classes in the project. Neither we setup configuration values such as `userLookUp.userDomainClass` etc.

Now we override the `login/auth` view. So that we no longer show a username/password form in that page.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/views/login/auth.gsp
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/login/auth.gsp[indent=0]
----

We don't include a button to SignIn with Google in that page because we have included that button in root layout _main.gsp_ file.
